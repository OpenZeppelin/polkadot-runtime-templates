= RPC Differences

The EVM in a Substrate node has almost the same RPC calls common to all nodes. But some of them are not applicable for Frontier.

These are the calls that behave differently than would be expected by regular Ethereum nodes:

* `eth_sign` / `eth_signTransaction` -- these methods do not exist in the Frontier and this template because it, unlike Ethereum nodes, does not hold any keys.
* `eth_syncing` -- it can have additional fields `warp_chunks_amount` and `warp_chunks_processed` that describe warp syncing process.

Other calls comply to the same scheme as Ethereum nodes provide.
